# Android Compose Example with MVI Pattern
## (Only Learning Purpose for Beginners)
This Android Compose example showcases the implementation of the Model-View-Intent (MVI) architectural pattern. MVI is a reactive architecture that divides the application into three main components: Model, View, and Intent. The pattern emphasizes a unidirectional data flow, making it easier to manage and reason about the application's state.

## Key Components:

### DataState:
A sealed class representing different states of data (Loading, Success, Empty, Error).

### User:
A data class representing the model for a user.

### UserRepository:
The repository class responsible for managing data operations. It interacts with the data source (UserDao) and applies business logic before emitting data states.

### UserEvent:
A sealed class representing user actions or intents. In this example, there's a single event for getting the list of users.

### UserViewModel:
The ViewModel class follows the MVI pattern, handling user events, interacting with the repository, and managing the UI state using a MutableStateFlow.

### UserListUI:
A Composable function for displaying the user list UI. It triggers the GetUsersEvent and observes the UI state, updating the UI components accordingly.
UserListLoadingUI, UserListSuccessUI, UserEmptyListUI, UserListErrorUI:

Composable functions representing different UI states. They are invoked based on the current DataState, providing a clear separation of UI concerns.

## Usage:
1. The application starts by displaying a loading state as it fetches the user list.
2. Once the data is loaded, the UI transitions to a success state, presenting the sorted user list.
3. If the user list is empty, an appropriate empty state UI is shown.
4. In case of an error, an error state UI is displayed, providing feedback to the user.

This example simple demonstrates a clean and modular approach to building Android applications with Jetpack Compose and the MVI architectural pattern. The separation of concerns and unidirectional data flow contribute to a more maintainable and scalable codebase. Developers can leverage this pattern to create reactive and efficient user interfaces in their Android applications.
